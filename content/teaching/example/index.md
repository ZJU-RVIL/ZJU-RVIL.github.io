      title: Advanced Robotics (2022 Fall)
      subtitle: Robotics Course for undergrad and grad students
      text: | 
        
        ## General Description

        This course is structured into three segments: A) Robot Mechanics, B) Dynamics & Control C) Planning & Perception. First, learners will be familiarized with the fundamentals relevant to the course, namely, homogeneous transformations, forward and inverse kinematics, velocity kinematics and eventually acquainted to the essentials including robot dynamics and controls. Finally, applied topics related to robot planning and perception covering path and motion planning, image formation, processing and analysis, vision-based control and image-guided robotics will be introduced to learners relating the fundamentals and essentials acquired in the earlier part of the course

        ## Course Objective
        The goal of this course is to introduce students to the basic concepts in robotics that 
        * provide prerequisite knowledge for follow-on courses, 
        * (b) provide essential knowledge of the field that would be required by a practicing engineer who must deal with automation, and 
        * (c) provides professional development by introducing best practices and ethical considerations for engineering design. 
        
        This course also includes a significant laboratory component.
